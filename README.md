# cspell-words

My custom list of words for the [Code Spell Checker plugin for VS Code](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker).
If you want to use this list you can open up the .vscode folder and edit the settings.json file. Just paste the contents of the settings.json file from this repo, into your projects's .vscode/settings.json file. Right after the opening brace works as does right before the closing brace. If you do the latter be sure to put a comma after the last item and then take off the trailing comma after this item so that settings.json is still valid JSON.
