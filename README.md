# cspell-words

My custom list of words for the [Code Spell Checker plugin for VS Code](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker).

According to the FAQ you can put the `cspell.json` file at the root of your project and all the words contained in it will be considered spelled correctly. 

Alternately, you can paste the contents of the `settings.json` file from this repo, into your projects's `.vscode/settings.json` file. Just be careful about leading and trailing commas. VSCode will help, if there are no red squigglies, you should be good to go.
