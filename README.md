# cspell-words

My custom list of words for the [Code Spell Checker plugin for VS Code](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker).
If you want to use this list you can open up the .vscode folder and edit the settings.json file. Just paste the settings.json file right
after the open brace. You can place it anywhere it doesn't conflict with an existing item in the file
